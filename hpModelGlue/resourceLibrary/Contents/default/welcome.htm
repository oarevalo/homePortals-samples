<p>Welcome to the HomePortals/Model-Glue skeleton!</p>

<p>
	This sample application shows how to use the HomePortals framework to
	provide additional features into applications built with
	another framework.
</p>

<p>
	In this example the application is built using the host framework, 
	however the layout rendering is delegated to the HomePortals engine.
	This allows the page to include elements provided by HomePortals, such
	as the RSS Reader and Image widgets on the right column, and static
	content resources (this paragraph, and the header title); while
	at the same time including output from framework even requests (the
	two modules below)
